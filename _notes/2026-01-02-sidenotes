# Using AI to organise my writing and thoughts
I use AI to check my content. I give it strict instructions to check for grammar and punctuation only.

Has it made me lazier? I don't think so.

I use a combination of text-to-speech and typing, depending on whether I am in public or alone. If anything, it has made me better at punctuation. I love how it provides timely feedback and explains each change it introduces and why.

My thoughts come all at once; the words rush through without order. AI helps me put some order into that. I would have never thought of writing without it. It has made me more confident. I used to think of myself as a visual person only, as that is the "muscle" I have been training my entire life.

When AI first appeared, I remember having doom-and-gloom predictions, including photographers and graphic designers being replaced. This was before Adobe started offering these services, but I am guessing they were already working on them.

Then it started taking over online learning. I am now asked to use AI to generate audio, video, and e-learning interactions. Consequently, my work in audio, video, graphics, and web design is being phased out.
I, like many others by now, have a complicated relationship with AI. It helps me organise my words and put them in writing, in the hope that others will make more sense of me and see me less like an alien and more like a human. On the other hand, society only had a place for me as long as I provided technical skills at a faster and better rate than most of my peers. If those are no longer needed as AI usage increases, then I am no longer needed.
I see it every day. For the past few years, I have received more praise for my work than ever, yet I am noticing less effort and tolerance for my way of being. And that is the thing: I don’t want tolerance and acceptance. I want respect.
I feel I started with one idea and have diverged. That is for a different reflection.
