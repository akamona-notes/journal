# Am I the only one who thinks autistic traits are about values, not status?
## Visionary branding failing the autistic community. 

Am I the only one who thinks that honesty, deep technical focus, and a lack of interest in status are the true defining traits of autism?

I am increasingly bothered by the trend of people trying to diagnose historical figures like Einstein, Jobs, Edison, or Darwin. No one truly knows their minds, no psychiatrist ever evaluated them, and no reputable professional would attempt to diagnose a person they have never seen based solely on historical records.

Furthermore, there is a clear divide in values between figures like Edison and Tesla, or Jobs and Wozniak. To me, it’s like comparing Star Wars with Star Trek.

On one side, you have the technical purists like Tesla and Wozniak. They are deeply honest, might be socially awkward, and focused on the work rather than the profit. These are the people who struggle to protect their own interests because they simply don't care about the brand/selling.
On the other side, you have the visionary salesmen seeing profit like Edison and Jobs. They are known for ruthlessness, taking credit for the work of others, and aggressive marketing. They represent success and wealth, the winners in a capitalist society.

What is Autism? Is it just a neurodivergent difference in how we process the world, or is it fundamentally associated with certain values? Is it about internal validation (the integrity of the work) or external validation (status and marketability)?

Am I comparing apples to pears, or is there a deeper relationship here? I believe that by focusing on the visionary and successful (aka wealthy), we are losing sight of the honesty and technical integrity that actually defines many of us. We are being replaced in the workplace by talkers who use our prompts and our expertise, while the traits that make us who we are get to be devalued.

I am only speaking from my own experience and from observing those similar to me. I am well aware that the spectrum is vast. I did notice this worrying trend that yesterday, we were just socially awkward geeks, whilst today, I feel this label is being hijacked by people who exploit it to build their own brands or to provide a convenient explanation for their bad behavior. It’s being used to add dimension to otherwise flat and boring characters, transforming a ruthless sales agent into a complex, creative visionary. It’s a rebranding of the shark (apologies to actual sharks for using such a tired stereotype) into a misunderstood genius, and in the process, the actual values of honesty and integrity are being left behind.
