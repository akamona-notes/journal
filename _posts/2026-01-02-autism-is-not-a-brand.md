# Late-diagnosed autism is not a brand, not a superpower. It was supposed to be a lifeboat.
I am finding it increasingly difficult to find my people. I am looking for a space with no agenda and no sales pitch, just people sharing their struggles and connecting.
I am fed up with the noise. The internet is saturated with stories of "reinvention" and middle-class rebranding. I see people exploiting personal trauma for profit and hijacking comment sections to redirect attention to their merchandise. Most concerning is the way the autistic label is being hijacked and repurposed by some to add "character", make themselves appear more interesting.
For some of us, this diagnosis was never meant to be a resume embellishment. I sought a diagnosis out of despair, hoping it would be a lifeboat that might save my career. I thought it would allow me to continue working from home and provide the legal standing for the reasonable adjustments I needed to push through major stress.
Instead, the reality for many is being "managed out" of employment. This is especially true for middle-aged women navigating perimenopause and post-menopause. In the professional world, we are often no longer wanted. It seems the autistic label is only acceptable or "marketable" if you are a man or younger. 
For the rest of us, we simply become invisible again.
Everything online now feels branded. Everyone is selling their bit. I have taken a break from searching because I am tired of reading pre-packed "authentic" experiences. 
I have wasted enough time trying to check credentials and figure out who is actually behind a story and what they are trying to gain.
I am moving away from that. I will focus on sharing my reality, and if it finds you and resonates, say hi.
